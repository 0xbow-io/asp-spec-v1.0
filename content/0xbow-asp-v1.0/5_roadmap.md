# Development Roadmap

0xBow began building a PoC Association-Set Provider (ASP) in late december 2023 with the goal of luanching the
the first ASP service for Privacy Pool, a novel Zk-based privacy protocol.

**Throughout Q1 of 2024**, 0xBow continued to hit key milestones in the development of the ASP, proving
it's feasibility and utility for Privacy Pool. At EthDenver,
0xBow presented a live demo on stage, showcasing the ASP's capabilities and potentials.

**In Q2 2024**, progress began to enter troubling waters as difficulties surrounding Privacy Pool
delayed launch.

**In late April**, [Chainway Labs](https://chainway.xyz/) handed over Privacy Pool to 0xBow
to ensure it's completion. A transition that was not without it's challenges.

**In Q3 2024**, 0xBow has been working tirelessly on re-implementing Privacy Pool which involves
revisions of the zk-circuits, smart contracts and the UI Webapp.

**As 0xBow enters Q4 2024**, 0xBow's priorities remains unchanged:

- ## Production readiness

  The ASP and Privacy Pool are close to completion and will be ready for launch soon.

  0xBow has excersised engineering due-dilligence during the development lifecycle of the ASP
  and Privacy Pool. Compliance is not just an attribute of 0xBow's product, but also a core value
  of the organization.

- ## Secure Partnerships

  0xBow is actively engaging other protocols and organizatios such as to integrate
  the ASP with other systems. Key partnerships will be announced soon.

- ## Development Sustainability

  0xBow is committed to the long-term development of the ASP and Privacy Pool.
  0xBow's mission is to protect the future of on-chain privacy, and provide the infrastructure necessary
  to guarantee privacy as a public good.

  A more detailed roadmap for the next year and beyond will be published soon.

- ## Growth

  0xBow is actively seeking to grow it's team and is looking for talented individuals to join the team.
